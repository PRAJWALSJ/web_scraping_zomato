# web_scraping_zomato
Zomato is a food delivery and restaurants website which contains all the information about the restaurants listed on it. It is a dynamic website where it loads more number of restaurents as the user scrolls down the web page initially loading only 9 restaurants. I have extracted the information like name of the restaurant, address, contact number, fssai number, and all the items on menu for all the restaurants listed on the zomato website for a particular location(in this case patia, Bhubaneshwar, orissa). The location can be changed by just changing the master blink in the program. I have used web driver and selenium to load the whole web page for a given location by automating to scroll down till the bottom of the web page.
